# RWBY-Combat-Ready

Purpose:
The purpose of this program is to provide a simulator for villain decks for the card game RWBY-Combat-Ready so that people can play custom or existing villains in the game. This program does NOT play the entire game on its own and only serves as a means to play villain decks and keep track of and play their associated cards and events.


How to Use:
To use this program you must have a file that the program will accept with the villain deck with all of its cards in it. The program will prompt you for the name of this file. If you type it in without the extension, it will prompt you for the file extension and will give you a list of supported file types. You can type in the name of your file with the extension to skip this part. Once the program knows the name of the file and its type, it then attempts to open it. If it fails, it will prompt you for a different filename and type if you don't provide a type. If it succeds, then the program shuffles the deck you have given it and spaces the events out throughout the deck and you may play the game. You may enter 'q' or 'Q' at any point to close the program.

Once you are playing the game, the program then tells you what the stance of the next card it will draw is and allows you to draw the card, check all currently active events, or quit the game. Entering 'e' or 'E' will show all currently active events. Entering 'q' or 'Q' will quit the game. Entering anything else will draw the next card in the deck. The program will show you the card that was drawn, and if it was an event it is added to the list of currently active events that you can view at any time.


Accepted File Types and Formats:
The file types that this program accepts currently include '.txt', '.csv', and '.tsv'. For files that are one of these types, they must also be formatted in a specific way so that the program can correctly construct the villain deck. These formats are described below. Examples of how the program expects each of these files to be formatted are also included with the files of this program.

For '.txt' files, the format that the program expects is to have each line contain a card with the following attributes in this order separated by commas; Stance, Name, Speed, Damage, Card Type 1, Card Type 2, Card Effect, and Card Quantity. Card effects must not have commas in them for them to be properly processed. If a card only has one type, then the program expects the place where its 2nd would be to instead have 'None' there. If a cards has lacks a speed or damage values, such as event cards, the program excepts a '0' to be in that place instead. If the '.txt' file does not follow this format, then the cards will not be processed and added to the deck correctly. 

Files that are of type '.csv' and '.tsv' both follow similar formatting. This formatting is based on the spreadsheet that can be found with the files of the program. The program will first check what are the possible types a card can have by checking the line of the file containing the headers of each column. After it has stored these types, it then continues until it encounters one of the types of stances. Once it does, the program then assumes that every card it encouters will be of that particular stance. The program then reads each line and expects it to contain the following attributes in this order separated by commas for '.csv' files or tabs for '.tsv' files; Card Quantity, Card Name, Speed, Damage, Card Effect, Card Type 1, Card Type 2, Card Type 3, and Card Type 4. For each of the card types, the program check for the respective file's separator and sees if there is either a '1' or nothing. If it finds a '1', then it marks the card as the type that corresponds to that position. For example, a '1' in Card Type 2 would mean that the card it is currently looking at has the 2nd of the 4 possible types that it stored previously. The program expects a card to have at most 2 of these types. The program processes cards until it reaches a new stance, where it then switches what stance the cards are and continues processing. If the stance it sees is 'Event', it then checks for the total amount of event cards on the same line, and keeps track of how many cards it has processed while it is processing event cards. Once it has processed the same number of cards as it saw earlier, the program stops processing cards entirely. For this reason it expects event cards to be the last type of cards it processes and assumes all other cards in the deck have been processed once it is done with events. For '.csv' files, any effects that contain commas should be encapsulated in quotes, such as these "". These quotes are not required for '.tsv' files. If the '.csv' or '.tsv' file does not follow this format, then the cards will not be processed and added to the deck correctly. Both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets allow you to take an existing spreadsheet and save/download it as a '.csv' or '.tsv' file.
